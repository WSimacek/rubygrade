RubyGrade is built on RAILS 2.2.2

These 6 simple steps are the essentials to get you smoothly up and running...

# The default config/database.yml is configured for Sqlite3. (you can copy one of the other sample files in there and edit it if you need)
# Edit the config/config.yml file to suit your needs
# Open a shell and run @rake gems:install@ to install required gems, then @rake db:migrate@ to create your database and setup the prepared defaults. 
# Start your server with @./script/server@
# Open up "http://localhost:3000":http://localhost:3000 and login with username 'admin' and password 'yippeekayea'.
